# Nintendo DS Business Card â€” O(n) Sorting Visualization

This project transforms the Nintendo DS (or 3DS via backward compatibility) into an interactive digital business card that demonstrates a smooth, auto-looping **O(n) Counting Sort visualization** on the top screen while displaying a professional business card on the bottom screen.

Developed entirely in **C** using a **Linux (Ubuntu) terminal environment** through **WSL on Windows**, this project demonstrates low-level graphics rendering, efficient algorithm visualization, and embedded system programming on handheld hardware.

---

## Overview

The project integrates algorithmic visualization with Nintendo DS graphics programming using the `libnds` library. It serves as a demonstration of both **time complexity analysis** and **practical embedded development**.

- **Top Screen:** Continuously randomizes and sorts colored bars using Counting Sort (O(n)).
- **Bottom Screen:** Displays a static business card with academic and contact information.

This program was built and compiled using `devkitPro` tools under a Linux terminal workflow.
